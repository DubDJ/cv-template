## Synopsis

![CV Template Screens]
(http://hassancorrigan.com/img/project-img-2.png)

A simple one-page CV template webpage. Built with HTML5 and CSS3 with an optional jQuery navigation bar. Lightweight code and simple document styled page.
Edit the code and add your own details, create your own online CV.

## Customise

Simply edit the appropriate sections of the index.html using any text-editor (e.g. Notepad, TextEdit, Notepad++ ect.) and save the changes. Add custom font's, colours or anything else you like to the CSS file.

## Motivation

A CV can sometimes vary across document types (e.g. Microsoft Word, Apple's Pages etc.) which can change the layout and sometimes lead to some bad formatting.

I created this simple online alternative as a way for ensuring the design is consistent across multiple devices and operating systems.

## Installation

Simply copy the index and css files and upload to to your desired location.
